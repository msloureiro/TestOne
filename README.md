# SmartMed
## Back End code challenge

As a User I want to have a REST API that allow to:

- get a list of medications
- create a new medication
- delete a medication

### **Remark:**
- First time with C# and .NET Core

### Database Technoloy: PostgreSQL
- used a docker-compose to host our postgres and pgadmin

## Out of scope:
- unit test
- documentation

## Running the SMARTMEDICINESTESTAPI

1. in the terminal run the command ``dotnet run``
2. open ``https://localhost:7071/swagger/index.html`` to test the API
